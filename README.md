# BbtB2017-workshop
Adafruit Trinket project for Bricks by the Bay 2017

Bricks by the Bay is an annual LEGO enthusiasts conference, in the Silicon Valley, in late July or early August.

This project was a simple workshop, with an introduction to Arduino, including a pre-wired Trinket, with a pre-loaded sketch.

The wiring diagram is documented in ASCII art in comments within the sketch.

I'm hoping that some (25%?) of the workshop attendees will learn to use the IDE and attempt to modify their Trinket programming.

The purpose for posting the sketch here is to have a "back to as-delivered state" version for them to reload.
(Note that the IDE will want to put the sketch file into an enclosing folder by the same name. That's expected.)
